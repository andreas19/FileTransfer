Using filetransfer
==================

.. literalinclude:: usage.txt
   :language: none


To start a job the JOBID (which is the :ref:`ref-job-configuration` filename without
the extension) must be given on the commandline. When starting multiple jobs e.g. from
a crontab the environment variable FILETRANSFER_CFG can be set to the path of the 
application configuration file so that it can be omitted on the commandline of each job.

It is also possible to get hostkeys from SFTP servers and save them to a file. Deleting
the keys from the file is also possible.
