Using filetransfer
==================

.. literalinclude:: usage.txt
   :language: none


To start a job the JOBID (which is the :ref:`job configuration <ref-job-configuration>`
filename without the extension) must be given on the commandline. When starting multiple
jobs e.g. from a crontab the environment variable FILETRANSFER_CFG can be set to the path
of the :ref:`application configuration file <ref-app-configuration>`
so that it can be omitted on the commandline of each job.

It is also possible to get hostkeys from SFTP servers and save them to or delete them from
the known-hosts file.
