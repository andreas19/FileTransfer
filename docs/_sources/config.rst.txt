Configuration
=============

To run a file transfer two configurations (application and job) are
needed. Both are INI-style files.

In the tables below strings in single quotes must be given literally
(case insensitive) and without the quotes.

See: example :ref:`ref-configuration-files`


Application Configuration
-------------------------

This configuration contains some global properties. It is the file
that is set with the ``--config`` option or the ``FILETRANSFER_CFG``
environment variable (see: :doc:`usage`).

Job Configuration
-----------------

A job configuration file must have a name of the form :file:`{JOB_ID}.cfg`
(e.g. ``job001.cfg`` where ``job001`` is the job id) and it must be
saved in the ``jobs_dir`` directory as defined in the application configuration.

   :file: job_cfg.csv


Hosts Configuration
-------------------

A hosts configuration contains sections which each define a configuration of
a host as in the ``[source]`` and ``[target]`` sections of a job
configuration. Such a host configuration can be referenced by setting the
``host_id`` in those sections to the section name of a host configuration.
