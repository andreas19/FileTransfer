Configuration
=============

All configuration files are INI-style files.

In the tables below strings in single quotes must be given literally
(case insensitive) and without the quotes.

The paths mentioned in the configuration files must be either absolute
or relative to the working directory of the *filetransfer* process.

See: example :ref:`ref-configuration-files`


.. versionchanged:: 0.6.0
   - *Host configuration* is now only allowed in
     :ref:`host configuration files <ref-hosts-configuration>`.
     ``hosts_cfg`` in the :ref:`application configuration <ref-app-configuration>`
     and ``host_id`` in the sections [source] and [target] in
     :ref:`job configurations <ref-job-configuration>` are not optional any more
     when using FTP, FTPS or SFTP.
   - *SFTP authentication keyfiles* in :ref:`host configurations <ref-hosts-configuration>`
     must now have their type declared with ``key_type``

.. versionchanged:: 0.7.0
   - The *password* option in host configurations is now required except
     for SFTP when an authentication key is used.
   - Option ``name`` moved from section ``[notify]`` to the new section ``[job]``
     in :ref:`job configuration <ref-job-configuration>`.

.. _ref-app-configuration:

Application Configuration
-------------------------

This configuration contains some global properties. It is the file
that is set with the ``--config`` option or the ``FILETRANSFER_CFG``
environment variable (see: :doc:`usage`).

.. _ref-job-configuration:

Job Configuration
-----------------

A job configuration file must have a name of the form :file:`{JOB_ID}.cfg`
(e.g. ``job001.cfg`` where ``job001`` is the job id; the extension ``.cfg`` can
be changed in the application configuration) and it must be
saved in the ``jobs_dir`` directory as defined in the application configuration.

.. _ref-hosts-configuration:

Hosts Configuration
-------------------

A hosts configuration contains sections each of them defining a configuration of
a host. Such a host configuration can be referenced by setting the
``host_id`` in the ``[source]`` and ``[target]`` sections in
a :ref:`job configuration <ref-job-configuration>` to the section name.
